<!-- The Foley group works by the motto the difficult we do immediately, the impossible takes a little longer. -->
We are deeply interested in the bilateral interaction between light and matter. We are fascinated by the way that matter can profoundly change light. By shining light on nanostructured matter, we can squeeze light into dimensions much smaller than its wavelength, slow light to speeds much smaller than its speed in a vacuum, and cause light to carry much more momentum than usual. This modified light can then interact with atoms and molecules in new and unusual ways. We can use modified light to deposit energy into chemical bonds with surprising efficiency, report back details about the structure and reactivity of matter, and even drive the assembly of complex structures without mechanical intervention. One of the “impossible” dreams that captivates the imagination of the Foley group is the ability to understand and model physical laws to such an extent that they can be used to design material systems capable of coaxing light to interact with atoms and molecules in precisely the ways that we desire. Realizing this dream would have far-reaching consequences for many applications, including solar energy conversion, catalysis, imaging, information storage, and the fabrication of nanoscale materials, to name a few. 

We pursue these interests by seeking to discover and elucidate new phenomena that occur when light interacts with nanoscale materials. We also explore how these phenomena can induce change in material and chemical systems. The basis of our exploration is the study and application of theoretical methods based on the physical laws of quantum mechanics and electrodynamics. In some cases, appropriate theoretical tools are not available for these explorations. We seek to create new theoretical tools when they are needed. 

The Foley group believes that scientific progress results from the dogged pursuit and critical examination of creative insights that gradually chip away at mysteries of the natural world, or move closer to the solution of problems that have societal relevance. We believe that the originators of these insights can be novices as well as experts, perhaps both working together. We believe that the examination of scientific ideas is most effective when approached from multiple angles, often invoking complementary experimental and theoretical exploration. We welcome collaboration and participation from curious individuals from all scientific disciplines and with all levels of scientific accomplishment

### Light Initiated Energy Transfer with Composite Nanostructures

<!-- <div class="box"> <p> -->
The interaction between light and nanostructures can give rise to a number of different resonant phenomena, including plasmon resonances in metal nanoparticles, excitonic resonances in semiconductor nanoparticles, and scattering resonances in dielectric (i.e. optically transparent) nanoparticles.  An exciting feature of these resonant phenomena is that they provide opportunities to control the flow of optical energy at the nanoscale, a prospect which has important implications for renewable energy technologies among others.  Creating hybrids of various nanoscale materials can often lead to new emergent phenomena, giving us yet more levers of control over light at the nanoscale.

We have been investigating a class of composite nanostructures that consist of relatively large nanospheres made from dielectric materials, one example being glass, decorated with very small metal nanoparticles.  We have demonstrated that these composites support a novel optical phenomenon we call scattering mediated absorption (SMA). Metals nanoparticles have broad absorption, whereas dielectric nanospheres have narrow scattering features; by combining both of these materials, an emergent property is observed which only arises in hierarchical nanoparticles. The interaction between the dielectric nanoparticles causes certain frequencies of light to reside within the dielectric nanosphere for a prolonged period of time. The light trapped in the dielectric core causes strong absorption in the decorating metal nanoparticles, which is observed through absorption features that mimic the dielectric scattering features.  We are investigating how these emergent resonances can be used to drive chemical transformations on molecules adsorbed to the surfaces of the metal nanoparticles.

A second class of composite nanostructures we have been investigating consist of stacks of nanofilms whose emergent properties allow us to control how they radiate heat.  In particular, such composite planar structures can leverage the interaplay between two resonant phenomena that can be realized in simple planar nanostructures: resonant absorption in weakly-absorbing thin films and reflection resonances in multi-layer dielectric stacks (Bragg Reflectors). The interplay between these resonances enables spectral tunability of the composite nanostructures, 
which is what enables us to control how these structures
radiate heat.  One application that can benefit from this ability to control thermal emission 
is a technology known as solar thermophotovoltaics, which 
has the potential to achieve solar conversion efficiencies approaching 85%.

As a consequence of the simple geometry of these composite structures, their thermal emission profiles can be
predicted using simple analytical equations with solutions that can be efficiently evaluated on a computer.  Leveraging this
fact, we have developed and are deploying
simple computational machinery to virtually screen millions of candidate structures.
