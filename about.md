<!-- The Foley group works by the motto the difficult we do immediately, the impossible takes a little longer. -->
We are deeply interested in the bilateral interaction between light and matter. We are fascinated by the way that matter can profoundly change light. By shining light on nanostructured matter, we can squeeze light into dimensions much smaller than its wavelength, slow light to speeds much smaller than its speed in a vacuum, and cause light to carry much more momentum than usual. This modified light can then interact with atoms and molecules in new and unusual ways. We can use modified light to deposit energy into chemical bonds with surprising efficiency, report back details about the structure and reactivity of matter, and even drive the assembly of complex structures without mechanical intervention. One of the “impossible” dreams that captivates the imagination of the Foley group is the ability to understand and model physical laws to such an extent that they can be used to design material systems capable of coaxing light to interact with atoms and molecules in precisely the ways that we desire. Realizing this dream would have far-reaching consequences for many applications, including solar energy conversion, catalysis, imaging, information storage, and the fabrication of nanoscale materials, to name a few. 

We pursue these interests by seeking to discover and elucidate new phenomena that occur when light interacts with nanoscale materials. We also explore how these phenomena can induce change in material and chemical systems. The basis of our exploration is the study and application of theoretical methods based on the physical laws of quantum mechanics and electrodynamics. In some cases, appropriate theoretical tools are not available for these explorations. We seek to create new theoretical tools when they are needed. 

The Foley group believes that scientific progress results from the dogged pursuit and critical examination of creative insights that gradually chip away at mysteries of the natural world, or move closer to the solution of problems that have societal relevance. We believe that the originators of these insights can be novices as well as experts, perhaps both working together. We believe that the examination of scientific ideas is most effective when approached from multiple angles, often invoking complementary experimental and theoretical exploration. We welcome collaboration and participation from curious individuals from all scientific disciplines and with all levels of scientific accomplishment

### Light Initiated Energy Transfer with Composite Nanostructures

  <p>
Light can be seen as a powerful and abundant reagent in chemistry, having both the ability to steer chemical transformations in desired directions, and the ability to report back information on chemical structure and dynamics.  The fundamental ways in which matter interacts with light changes as one or more of the features of that matter approach the nanoscale (10-9 m). Nanostructured matter can have a profound impact on light, having the potential to confine it well beyond the diffraction limit, slow it down to speed much slower than the speed of light in a vacuum, and impart to it much more momentum than it would carry while propagating freely [2,3]. Considerable effort has gone into developing new ways to detect, image, and control chemical systems with ever greater precision by exploiting the various new ways in which light behaves when it interacts with nanostructured matter.
