# Onboarding Exercise

1. **Clone** the provided onboarding repository to your machine.
2. **Create a branch** named `feature/add-<yourname>`.
3. **Add a bio** in `team/<yourname>.md` and a tiny script/notebook that prints or plots something.
4. **Commit** your changes with a meaningful message.
5. **Push** your branch and **open a Pull Request** on GitHub.
6. **Review** a teammate’s PR: leave one suggestion and one positive comment.
7. **Merge** the PR (squash & merge) and **pull** the updated `main` locally.
8. **Bonus (optional):** Resolve a synthetic merge conflict in a provided test file.

## Tips
- Keep commits small and messages clear.
- Ask for help when you hit a conflict—this is normal!
