The Molecular Sciences Software Institute (MolSSI) is an 
NSF‚Äêfunded institute that focuses on improving software, 
education, and training the computational molecular sciences. 
Through a collaboration with the Molecular Education and Research 
Consortium in Undergraduate computational chemistRY (MERCURY), the 
Institute has developed resources for undergraduate and other 
early career students to lay an educational foundation for the next 
generation of computational molecular scientists.
