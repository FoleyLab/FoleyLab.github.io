Jay is named one of the 2019 Cottrell Scholars by the Research Corporation for Scientific Advancement!  
An award of $100,000 over three years will support our research and educational efforts in the lab.
Specifically, the award will support our work on polaritonic chemistry with hybrid nanoparticles,
and the development of pedagogical tools that aim to enhance students intuition about spectroscopy and light-matter interactions
while strengthening their general quantitative reasoning skills.  The full list of 2019 Cottrell Scholars can be found [here!](http://rescorp.org/news/2019/02/rcsa-names-two-dozen-2019-cottrell-scholars)
