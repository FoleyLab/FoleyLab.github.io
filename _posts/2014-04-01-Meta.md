Propagating optical eigenmodes are found in densely packed monolayers of 
plasmonic nanoparticles on a metal mirror. FDTD numerical calculations show that these 2D 
waves carry strongly confined and amplified light energy directly in the layer of nanoparticles 
or in the gap between the nanoparticles and the mirror. The extreme amplification of light 
intensity and localization at the nanoscale offer a high potential of these waves for photon 
emission, light harvesting, and waveguiding applications.
