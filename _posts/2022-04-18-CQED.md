We combine ab initio molecular electronic Hamiltonians with a cavity quantum electrodynamics model for dissipative photonic modes and
apply mean-field theories to the ground- and excited-states of resulting polaritonic systems. In particular, we develop a non-Hermitian config-
uration interaction singles theory for mean-field ground- and excited-states of the molecular system strongly interacting with a photonic mode
and apply these methods to elucidating the phenomenology of paradigmatic polaritonic systems. We leverage the Psi4Numpy framework to
yield open-source and accessible reference implementations of these methods.
