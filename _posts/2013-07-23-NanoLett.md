Synthesis of nanoparticle dimers made of asymmetric compositions 
is very challenging because of the difficulty in manipulating the 
nanoparticles’ surface chemistries in order to control the assembly 
and/or growth of different nanoparticles. In this Letter, we report 
a seed-mediated, surface-confined epitaxial overgrowth strategy that 
enables the synthesis of high-quality interfaced Au–Ag heterodimers 
in the quantum size regime (diameters <10 nm). Au and Ag share a 
common face-centered cubic lattice and have nearly identical lattice 
constants, which facilitates epitaxial overgrowth and allows direct 
contact between the Au and Ag domains. Quantum size effects, formation 
of the Au/Ag interfaces, and chemical interactions with surfactant 
molecules strongly influence the optical properties of the dimers and 
lead to the observation of unique surface plasmon resonances. In particular, 
we find an unusual enhancement of the characteristic Au surface plasmon 
resonance and the emergence of a charge transfer plasmon across the Au/Ag 
domains, which together lead to broad-band absorption spanning visible to 
near-infrared wavelengths. A model that captures the changes in optical 
behavior due to chemical interactions and quantum size effects is used 
to calculate the absorption spectra of the interfaced heterodimers, 
resulting in good agreement with experimental measurements.
