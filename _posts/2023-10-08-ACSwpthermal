Designing materials on the nanoscale can have a profound impact on how optical
energy flows through those materials, which can in turn dramatically improve the
performance ofnanostructuredmaterialsfor energy-related applicationsincluding
solar and (solar)thermophotovoltaic energy conversion, radiative cooling,
incandescent lighting, among others. Multilayer nanostructures represent an
important class of materials with tunable optical and thermal radiative properties
that can be leveraged for a wide range of energy applications. We have developed
an open-source software package called WPTherml (William Paterson
Universityâ€™s tool for Thermal Energy and Radiation management with Multilayer
nanostructures) that couples rigorous electrodynamics computations to thermal
radiation equations and aims to provide a powerful computational design engine
for multilayer nanostructures for applications where control of optical and/or
thermal radiation properties are paramount. This software package also provides
opportunities to engage undergraduate students in computational research
opportunities that span a fairly large range of technical demand in terms of
programming experience. The modern software development best practices we
follow in developing and maintaining the WPTherml also provide surprising
opportunities for building student-centered pedagogical practices into the
research environment. We will describe the development and use of this software
tool in a primarily undergraduate research environment and highlight several
research projects students have undertaken with this tool.
