Our proposal, entitled “Light Initiated Energy Transfer to Petroleum-Derived Molecules Mediated by Hybrid Nanoparticles”, was funded by the American Chemical Society Petroleum Research Fund.  The award of $55,000 over two years will support our efforts to develop and apply new theoretical methodologies for studying the flow of energy in multi-scale assemblies of nanoparticles and molecules.
