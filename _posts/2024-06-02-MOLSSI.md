 The University of North Carolina Charlotte is hosting the Workshop in Computational Chemistry on June 3-7, 2024, in partnership with the Molecular Sciences Software Institute (MolSSI) and the Center for Many-body Methods and Spectroscopies for Polariton Chemistry (MAPOL). Jay co-led this five-day workshop for undergraduate students majoring in chemistry related fields, along with Prof. Ashley McDonald from California Polytechnic State University and Dr. Jessica Nash of the Molecular Sciences Software Institute (MolSSI). The workshop focuses on scientific programming skills and applications in computational chemistry. Our goal is to enhance the studentsâ€™ opportunity to land an undergraduate research experience, job, or internship in computational chemistry.
