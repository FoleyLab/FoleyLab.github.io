Jay co-led a five-day workshop for undergraduate students majoring in chemistry related fields, along
with Prof. Ashley McDonald from California Polytechnic State University and Dr. Jessica Nash of the Molecular Sciences Software Institute (MolSSI).  The event was sponsored by MolSSI and the Tapia Center at Rice University.
One of several outcomes was the generation of an ab initio molecular dynamics simulation of the vibrational
motion of a diatomic, which can be found [here!](https://github.com/FoleyLab/2019-Tapia-MolSSI/blob/master/Ab_Initio_MD_template.ipynb)
