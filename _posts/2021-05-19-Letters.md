The influence of external dielectric environments is well understood for 2D
semiconductor materials but overlooked for colloidally grown II−VI nanoplatelets (NPLs). In
this work, we synthesize MX (M = Cd, Hg; X = Se, Te) NPLs of varying thicknesses and apply
the Elliott model to extract exciton binding energiesreporting values in good agreement with
prior methods and extending to less studied cadmium telluride and mercury chalcogenide
NPLs. We find that the exciton binding energy is modulated both by the relative effect of
internal vs external dielectric and by the thickness of the semiconductor material. An analytical
model shows dielectric screening increases the exciton binding energy relative to the bulk by
distorting the Coulombic potential across the NPL surface. We further confirm this effect by
decreasing and recovering the exciton binding energy of HgTe NPLs through washing in
polarizable solvents. Our results illustrate NPLs are colloidal analogues of van der Waals 2D
semiconductors and point to surface modification as an approach to control photophysics and
device properties.
