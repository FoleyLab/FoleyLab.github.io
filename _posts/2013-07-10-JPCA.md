Recent experiments show that the cage isomer of the water hexamer 
is lower in energy than the prism isomer near 0 K, and yet state-of-the-art 
electronic structure calculations predict the prism to be lower in energy than the 
cage at 0 K. Here, we study the relative energies of the water hexamers from the 
parametric two-electron reduced density matrix (2-RDM) method in which the 2-RDM 
rather than the wave function is the basic variable of the calculations. In agreement 
with experiment and in contrast with traditional wave function methods, the 2-RDM 
calculations predict the cage to be more stable than the prism after vibrational 
zero-point correction. Multiple configurations from the hydrogen bonding are captured 
by the method. More generally, the results are consistent with our previous 2-RDM applications 
in that they reveal how multireference correlation in molecular systems is important for 
resolving small energy differences from hydrogen bonding as 
well as other types of intermolecular forces, even in systems that are not 
conventionally considered strongly correlated.
