We present a non-Hermitian formulation of the polaritonic structure of azobenzene strongly 
coupled to a photonic mode that explicitly accounts for the fleeting nature of the 
photon–molecule interaction. This formalism reveals that the polaritonic nonadiabatic 
couplings that facilitate cis–trans isomerization can be dramatically modified by photonic 
dissipation. We perform Fewest-Switches Surface Hopping dynamics on the surfaces that derive 
from our non-Hermitian formalism and find that the polaritonic isomerization yields are strongly 
suppressed for moderate dissipation rates and that cavity-free isomerization dynamics are recovered 
under large dissipation rates. These findings highlight the important role that the finite lifetime 
of photonic degrees of freedom play in polaritonic chemistry.
