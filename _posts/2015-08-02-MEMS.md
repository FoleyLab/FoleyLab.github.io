We describe a dielectric Huygens metasurfaces capable to manipulate light in the visible regime with 100% transmission efficiency. The metasurface is comprised of TiO 2 cylindrical nanoparticles embedded in a medium with lower refraction index. The interaction between dielectric disks is considered and it is used as a parameter to optimize the optical properties of the metasurface.
