In recent years, advancements in photocatalysis have al-
lowed for a plethora of chemical transformations under milder condi-
tions. Many of these photochemical reactions utilize hydrogen atom
transfer processes to obtain desired products. Hydrogen atom transfer
processes can follow one of two unique pathways: the first, a direct
path and the second, an indirect path. In this paper, we highlight the
ability of eosin Y to act as a direct hydrogen atom transfer catalyst from
both synthetic and computational chemistry perspectives.
