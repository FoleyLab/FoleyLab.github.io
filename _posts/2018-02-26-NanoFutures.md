Silver-doped silver chloride [AgCl(Ag)] nanoparticles represent a unique class of visible-light-driven
photocatalysts, in which the silver dopants introduce electron-abundant mid-gap energy levels to lower the
bandgap of AgCl. However,free-standing AgCl(Ag) nanoparticles, particularly those with small sizes and
large surface areas, exhibit low colloidal stability and low compositional stability upon exposure to light
irradiation, leading to easy aggregation and conversion tometallic silver and thus a loss of photocatalytic
activity. These problems could be eliminated by attaching the small AgCl(Ag) nanoparticles to the surfaces
of spherical dielectric silica particles with submicrometer sizes. The high optical transparency in the visible
spectral region (400–800 nm), colloidal stability, and chemical/electronic inertness displayed by the silica
spheres make them idealfor supporting photocatalysts and significantly improving their stability. The
spherical morphology of the dielectric silica particles can support light scattering resonances to generate
significantly enhanced electric fields near the silica particle surfaces, on which the optical absorption
cross-section of the AgCl(Ag) nanoparticles is dramatically increased to promote their photocatalytic
activity. The hybrid silica/AgCl(Ag)structures exhibit superior photocatalytic activity and stability, suitable
for supporting photocatalysis sustainably;for instance, their efficiency in the photocatalytic decomposition
of methylene blue decreases by only ∼9% even after ten cycles of operation.
