Tailoring the emission spectra of a thermophotovoltaic (TPV) emitter away from that of a blackbody has the potential to 
minimize transmission and thermalization loss in a photovoltaic receiver. Selective TPV emitters can lead to solar 
energy conversion with efficiency greater than the Shockley–Queisser limit and can facilitate the generation of 
useful energy from waste heat. A new design is introduced to radically tune thermal emission that leverages the 
interplay between two resonant phenomena in simple planar nanostructures—absorption in weakly absorbing 
nanofilms and reflection in multilayer dielectric stacks. A virtual screening approach is employed to identify 
promising structures for a selective thermal emitter from a search space of millions, several of which approach the 
ideal values of a step‐function selective thermal emitter. One of these structures is experimentally fabricated and 
evaluated, which includes a weakly absorbing alloy with tailored optical properties fabricated by atomic 
layer deposition (ALD). The versatility of the design and fabrication approach result in an emitter with 
excellent spectral density (0.8 W cm−2 sr−1) and spectral efficiency (46.8%) at 1373 K. Future 
experimental challenges to a more accurate realization of the optimal structures calculated are also considered.
