We present a non-Hermitian formulation of the polaritonic structure 
of azobenzene strongly coupled to a photonic mode that explicitly 
accounts for the fleeting nature of the photon–molecule interaction. 
  This formalism reveals that the polaritonic nonadiabatic couplings 
  that facilitate cis–trans isomerization can be dramatically modified by 
  photonic dissipation. We perform Fewest-Switches Surface Hopping 
  dynamics on the surfaces that derive from our non-Hermitian formalism 
  and find that the polaritonic isomerization yields are strongly suppressed 
  for moderate dissipation rates and that cavity-free isomerization dynamics 
  are recovered under large dissipation rates. These findings highlight the 
  important role that the finite lifetime of photonic degrees of freedom play 
  in polaritonic chemistry.
