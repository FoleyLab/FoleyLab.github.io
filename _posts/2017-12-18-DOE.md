Noor's user proposal "Light Initiated Energy Transfer with Nanostructures" resulted in an award of 180,000 hours on the high-performance computing
facility at the Center for Nanoscale Materials at Argonne National Lab!  This award will help us to understand how we can use nano-engineered
matter to tailor the flow of energy to allow the control of chemical reactions.
