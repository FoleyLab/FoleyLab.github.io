Jay is moving to University of North Carolina Charlotte in Fall 2022!  We are looking forward to recruiting
students from UNCC Chemistry, the Nanoscale Science PhD Program, and the Optical Sciences and Engineering graduate program to grow our efforts to computationally design materials to control light and chemical reactivity!
