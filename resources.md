## Resources for Foley Lab Members

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/hpc.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span> 
This is page is meant to be a repository of useful information for Foley Lab members.  There is
a growing list of YouTube tutorials meant to familiarize you with some of the basics of computational work, including
how to remotely access the Foley Lab computers, how to edit files on a Linux machine, how to plot data with gnuplot, etc.
More general external resources are also provided below.

# General Resources

Being an effective researcher in the Foley Lab should be mutually beneficial - your efforts should 
contribute to your own intellectual and professional growth, and they should also further the [research goals of the Foley Lab](/about/). 
This situation doesn't arise by accident; it takes communication, planning, and purposeful effort from all parties.  
Below are some resources from people that have been influential in how I think about purposeful effort, persistence, and planning in research.  

1. [Google Talk on Growth Mindset by Prof. Carol Dweck](https://youtu.be/-71zdXCMU6A)

2. [Goole Talk on Grit by Prof. Angela Duckworth](https://youtu.be/W-ONEAcBeTk)

3. [Prof. George Whitesides' guide to writing a scientific paper](http://ee.ucr.edu/~rlake/Whitesides_writing_res_paper.pdf)

Other Useful Resources:

[Time evolution of a Gaussian Wavepacket](https://youtu.be/aE4eEP-V_V8)

- [Python code to generate animation of Gaussian Wavepacket](/assets/pib_wp.py)
