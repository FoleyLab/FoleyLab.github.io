External Resources:  Being an effective researcher in the Foley Lab should be mutually beneficial - your efforts should 
contribute to your own intellectual and professional growth, and they should also further the [research goals of the Foley Lab](/about/). 
This situation doesn't arise by accident; it takes communication, planning, and purposeful effort from all parties.  
Below are some resources from people that have been influential in how I think about purposeful effort, persistence, and planning in research.
