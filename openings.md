The Foley Lab is recruiting a postdoctoral scholar to begin in early 2023 to work on the development and implementation of scalable 
many-body methods for polaritonic chemistry! The scholar will work in a highly collaborative team of researchers, including Niri Govind and Karol Kowalski at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, and Xiaosong Li at University of Washington. Candidates who have research experience developing & using electronic structure theory methods, or who have experience developing & using cavity quantum electrodynamics models are strongly encouraged to apply. Successful candidates will have experience developing scientific software; additional training in software development best practices and in the use of libraries for developing software for leadership computing facilities will be provided.

Applications can be submitted [here](https://jobs.charlotte.edu/postings/45467).  Interested applicants can email Jay at <jfoley19@uncc.edu> for more information!
